# Gather, visualize, and analyze IoT (mobile) data

This web application once published to IBM Cloud and opened on a smart phone browser acts as an IoT device to publish accelerometer and Gyroscope data to Cloudant NoSQL database.

The web application is built for a [solution tutorial](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/tutorials/gather-visualize-analyze-iot-data.html) that walks you through
- Setting up an IoT device.
- Gathering mobile accelerometer and Gyroscope data in the Watson IoT Platform.
- Exploring data and creating visualizations and then using advanced machine learning services to analyze data and detect anomalies in the historical data.
